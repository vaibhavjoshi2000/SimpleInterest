Ques. While running the application how default route automatically set to SimpleInterest/CalculateSimpleInterest?
Sol->
URL Construction:

In the Razor view, Html.BeginForm generates the correct action URL (/SimpleInterest/CalculateSimpleInterest) based on the routing rules.
Route Matching:

When the form is submitted, ASP.NET MVC matches the URL to the correct controller (SimpleInterestController) and action method (CalculateSimpleInterest).

Ques. Why we use Html.BeginForm instead of form tag?
Sol->
While plain HTML works fine for basic forms, Html.BeginForm provides:

Integration with MVC features (routing, model binding, validation).
Cleaner, more maintainable code.
Better adaptability to changes in routing or application structure.
In an MVC project, using Html.BeginForm is the preferred practice for forms because it aligns with the MVC framework’s philosophy of convention over configuration and reduces the risk of errors.

@Ques. Why we use @using inside Razor View(.cshtml file)?
Sol->
Key Takeaway
@using is not the reason you can use Html helpers in Razor views—they are available by default. Instead, @using is for:

Managing namespaces.
Creating scoped disposable blocks like Html.BeginForm.
